# -python-challenge
Py Bank has a python program that will run through the csv file in the resources section of the pybank foulder. 
It should print out all the requested information requested. 
The python file in PyPoll should do everything asked. The problem I see with the way I did this program is that it can only collect the top 4 candidates. If I were to rewrite this program I would use lists with for loops to allow for any number of candidates to be processed. 

Thank_you
